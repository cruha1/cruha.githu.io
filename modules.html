										<p>This subject covers the fundamentals of JavaScript as well as the Processing JS package, which allows students to create drawings and animations. JavaScript is a popular scripting language that can be used to create webpages or libraries like p5.js when combined with HTML. As a result, it was critical to establish a solid foundation in this language, which this module enabled. Learning about variables, functions, logic and if statements, loops, arrays, objects, and object-oriented design was the most important takeaway for me from this session, as I now use these concepts on a regular basis when coding.</p>

										<p>This subject introduces students to HTML/CSS and enables them to create and design their own websites. It provides pupils with a firm base on which they can build using online projects and other resources. In my case, I went on to watch instructional Khan Academy videos and visit sites like Github to learn more about web pages. There is a lot that can be done with site design as the world evolves toward a digital future.</p>

										<p>This topic covered advanced JavaScript techniques for games and visualisations. Among the topics covered were creating programmes with several scenes, 3D graphics, button menus, and games with scores. Because it builds on JavaScript's applications, this module provides a basic introduction to game programming and graphics. As a result, I may continue my research in the future by going deeper into 3D visuals, using more complex game structures, desktop editors, and debugging tools to create sophisticated games and visualisations. Learning about buttons and transforms was the most crucial component of this subject for me. My knowledge of buttons allowed me to improve user participation in a number of programmes, including some of my own webpages.</p>

										<p>Like Games & Visualizations, this module built on the students' existing JavaScript knowledge. It's an intriguing unit that combines JS, Processing JS, physics, and mathematical principles to demonstrate the connections between the disciplines. The course focuses on imitating natural tendencies in nature using oscillations, trigonometry, angular movement, forces, vectors, noise, and randomness. For me, the strong emphasis on object-oriented programming was the most important aspect of this module because it helped me get more acquainted with the design, which will be crucial when working with complex data in my projects.</p>

										</header>
										<p>My team and I decided to make a calculator for our Hackathon. Our calculator was a huge success for us because we did not expect it to fully function and we encountered numerous issues along the way. Overall, this project taught me that teamwork is critical in computer science because each individual has strengths and weaknesses that can be overcome surprisingly quickly if you work together as a group.</p>

										<p>Flappy Bird, on the other hand, enabled our creative side and let us grasp and understand JavaScript even better than before; we turned a plain black-and-white dull game into a retro vibe game and updated many aspects including levels, user interaction, design, and so on.</p>

										</header>
										<p>This lesson challenged us to re-create one of Professor Daniel Shiffman's Coding sessions, as well as follow along with and alter the coding sessions of our classmates. This project helped students become more acquainted with object-oriented programming because we could use these tools to simply add our creative refactors while rebuilding the projects. It truly pushes students to solve difficulties by thinking outside the box. I can undertake more of Professor Shiffman's Coding Challenges on my own time to continue learning, as they cover a wide spectrum of critical JavaScript skills. Because I experienced various challenges along the way, the most important component of this challenge for me was being able to increase my understanding of object-oriented programming and practise debugging.</p>
